Built an autonomous predator agent to chase a live rodent prey using machine vision assisted localization, autonomous control theory, and custom built C++ software. Used ESP32 chips for wireless communications, analyzed efficiency and latency across low-level networking methods and optimized data packet size to deliver mapping responses in 3-8ms actionable window. Simulated motor functionality in Python, used CAD for chassis and wheel design, and Eagle for circuit design. Performed data analysis on experiments using the autonomous prey agent with pandas and matplotlib libraries. Trained and managed a team of five undergraduate researchers in novel custom software tools"
